## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements

- **Python 3.13+**

### ⚙️ Setup

#### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

In the root directory, run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2. Install Poetry

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/) for dependency management:

```bash
pip install -U pip setuptools
pip install poetry
```

---

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Use Poetry to install project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

> *(Note: This installs pandas, selenium, pyyaml, openai, and other core libraries).*

#### 4. Set Up Pre-Commit Hooks

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.ci/) hooks for static tests:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
